    "text": "Put a bucket underneath the crusher. Place it as high up as possible by stacking bricks under it.\nThrow in the glass through the chute. Avoid putting in too much at a time.\nSlowly turn the crank. If there is a noticeable resistance buildup, do not force the crank further. Instead, rotate it backward a bit, then go forward again. It might be necessary to repeat this multiple times. If this does not solve the issue, refer to the section What if the machine jams?.\nOnce all the glass has been crushed, the bucket can be removed.\n\n\n\n\nThe design was originally conceived in a way that allows the roller closest to the crank to be moved back and forth. The idea was that by adjusting the roller gap, different sizes of glass could be crushed and produced. Doing so involves the following steps:\n\nLoosen chain guides 1 & 2 (see Figure 1).\nLoosen the four bolts that are used to fasten the roller’s bearing brackets to their respective platform. The two bolts on the drivetrain side can be difficult to access; using an L-shaped hex socket wrench with a long shaft is recommended.\nMove the roller to adjust the gap from wide to narrow or vice versa.\nRefasten the bearing bracket bolts.\nSlide the chain guides downwards to put tension on the chain. Make sure the chain is in contact with the plastic sleeves and fasten the chain guides.\nPull on the chain to check if it is not too loose, then turn the crank to make sure that there is not too much tension either. If necessary, readjust.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE: The wider setting ultimately proved to be completely ineffective at crushing intact glass bottles—the sole reason it was included as a design feature in the first place; hence, the glass crusher ended up being used exclusively on the narrowest setting. The usefulness and effectiveness of the wider setting is thus not guaranteed.\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Chain tightening cylinders - loosen to change the roller gap or replace the chain."

    "text": "1 Overview\nFrom the very beginning of the test stage, it became clear that the crusher was unable to break intact glass bottles. On the wide setting, which was specifically implemented for this purpose, the crusher did manage to pull in the bottles, but the exerted force was not high enough to crush them. The crank arm jammed up each time, and even though it felt physically possible to push it further, the drivetrain was suspected to get damaged before the bottle would. A sturdier drivetrain and an even larger gear ratio would certainly help mitigate the problem; however, there are limits to the availability of motorcycle sprocket sizes and to the clearance within the crusher’s drivetrain. Since a 2-layer compound gear train would be counterproductive for the sturdiness issues, a solution would likely require a fundamental redesign of the drivetrain. Therefore, the crusher was instead considered to be a fixed system, restricted to the narrowest setting only. This decision was facilitated by the fact that the process of adjusting the roller gap turned out rather cumbersome anyway.\n\n\n2 Glass crushing results\nFor testing the bottles were broken using a hammer before loading into the crusher. Figure 1 shows some examples for the state the glass was in before being inserted into the crusher. Figure 2 shows an example for the result after sorting; it more specifically depicts the shards produced form the batch in Figure 1 (c). The shards produced by the crusher were sorted into three categories: Small for shards smaller than 1 cm, medium for shards between 1 cm and 3 cm, and large for shards larger than 3 cm.\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Smashed glass bottles before passing through the crusher. Included in images (a) and (b) is a 15 cm ruler.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2. Crushed glass sorted by size from small (a) to large (c) with a 15 cm ruler for scale.\n\n\nAs can be observed in Figure 3, there is some variation in the shard composition of the different batches, but overall, the medium category is always by far the predominant one, making up for 61 % to 77 % of the mass. There seems to be no clear trend regarding the percentages of small shards relative to the large ones, ranging from equal proportions to ratios slightly below 1:2 and vice versa. In short, with its single setting, the crusher is able to produce a variety of particle sizes ranging from powder to shards several centimeters long, but if one is only interested in a specific size, they have to be sieved first.\n\n\n\nFigure 3. Shard composition of the glass batches processed by the crusher.\n\n\nTo determine whether it makes sense to process the batches a second time to obtain a larger quantity of smaller shards, the large shards of the wine and liquor bottle were given a second pass through the crusher. Almost half of the wine bottle’s shards classified as small or medium afterwards, compared to only a quarter of the liquor bottle’s shards (Figure 4). Taking into account that the wine bottle’s shards were larger to begin with (Figure 5), thus decreasing their probability of getting through the crusher unscathed, this result is little surprising. In conclusion, repeated passes have diminishing benefits and are only worth the effort if the shards are still excessively large.\n\n\n\nFigure 4. Shard composition of the wine and liquor bottles’ large shards after giving them a second pass through the crusher.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5. The wine (a) and liquor (b) bottles’ large shards after the first pass through the crusher.\n\n\nOn two occasions during testing, the crusher jammed when it encountered a particularly rigid piece of glass. The first time it was caused by the circa 9 mm thick base of a Jägermeister bottle during one of the crusher’s preliminary tests (Figure 6 (a)), the second time by the neck of a cider bottle (Figure 6 (b)). After removing them, the crushing process was resumed without issues.\n\n\n\nFigure 6. Base of the Jägermeister bottle (a) and neck of the cider bottle (b) that caused the crusher to jam."
